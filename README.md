# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my 100-day machine learning challenge! This repository documents my journey as I write code daily to learn and practice machine learning concepts. Each day is focused on coding tasks, dataset exploration, and applying machine learning techniques.

## 🌟 Challenge Overview:
- **Start Date:** 20 January 2025
- **Goal:** To build a strong foundation in machine learning through hands-on coding.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
- `Week_1/`: Dataset Analysis and Exploration.
  - `Day_1/`: Titanic Dataset EDA ([Notebook](Week_1/Day_1/Titanic_EDA.ipynb))
  - `Day_2/`: Visualizations ([Notebook](Week_1/Day_2/Visualizations.ipynb))
- `Week_2/`: Preprocessing Pipelines.
  - `Day_8/`: Data Scaling ([Notebook](Week_2/Day_8/DataScaling.ipynb))
- ...

## 📊 Datasets Used:
1. Titanic Dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).

## 🏆 Progress
| Day | Task                         | Status |
